# GSoC2020_mcmcse_tests_solutions

My solutions for the Tests of the GSoC project 'mcmcse: updates, cleanup, and efficiency', under R stats

## Test 1 Easy:
(1) Download the mcmcse package from CRAN and use the function ess on a vector foo of length 1e4 randomly drawn from a standard normal distribution. <br>
(2) Make a random matrix of size 10 x 10 and produce only the eigenvalues of the matrix.

## Test 2 Medium:
Write a function that runs a Gaussian AR(1) model and use mcmcse to estimate the effective sample size.

## Test 3 Hard: 
Implement the replicated batch means estimator from this paper.
